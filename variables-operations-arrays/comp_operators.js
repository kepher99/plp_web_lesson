//String comparisons are case-sensitive, as shown in the example above.
console.log("ABC" == "abc");

//JavaScript also has two versions of each comparison operator: loose and strict.

//In strict mode, JavaScript will compare the types without performing a type coercion.

//You need to add one more equal = symbol to the operator as follows:
console.log("9" == 9);
console.log("9" === 9);
